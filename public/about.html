<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Snehaâ€”a passionate web developer and aspiring tech educator. As a student, I'm on a mission to master web development while helping others learn through my tech-based YouTube channel. I believe in making education accessible and engaging, empowering students with the skills they need to succeed in the digital world.  

Currently, I'm focused on **building websites, learning new technologies, and sharing my knowledge** through online courses. Whether it's coding, tech tips, or career guidance, my goal is to simplify complex topics and make learning fun.  

Join me on this journey as I explore the world of tech and turn my passion into a platform for growth and innovation!</p>
